Potential improvements:
 * Switch to magickwand/asynchttpclient instead of forking convert/curl.
 * Change the ImageMagick loading method (right now you set a static variable on
   the ImageHandler to the class which is a little wonky).
 * Push more of the backfill and warming functionality weâ€™re using in production
   into the base Ectyper codebase.
 * Add more image transformations (http://www.imagemagick.org/image/examples.jpg).
 * Extract Tornado and ImageMagick functionality into pluggable modules.
